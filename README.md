# The C Programming Language

An attempt at doing the exercises in The C Programming Langugage by Kernigan and Ritche. One goal is simply to improve my programming chops. (Practice makes perfect, repetition is the mother of learning, and so on.) Another goal is to study C; this simple and flexible language. Yet another goal is to study the book itself; for example its status as a classic and its alleged terseness sounds interesting.

## Running exercises

1. Start the included VS Code devcontainer.
2. Compile with `gcc <filename>`.
3. Run with `a.out`.
